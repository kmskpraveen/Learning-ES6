ES6 is basically EcmaScript 6 / EcmaScript 2015.

EcmaScript is not any scripting language instead a standard that Javascript is based upon. 
So, ES6 is a new version or new standard of Javascript.

ES6 brings many new feature like concept of classes, template tags, arrow functions etc.

Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 
but for the old browsers there are many transpilers e.g. Babel.js, Typescript, Traceur, etc.
those we need to include at top of our code to transpile ES6 to ES5 (Javascript with old standards).
